# Energy-System-Modelling-for-a-Low-Carbon-Future
* Context and background materials   
&emsp;This model will analyze five scenarios based on the Projections of energy system development into the future according to Australian Energy Market Operator's 2020 Intergrated system Plan(AEMO ISP) and supported by Two further highly-relevant reports.  
* Method and tools  
&emsp;This project focussed on free and open-source options, to stay away from licensing fees and potential vendor lock-in, and to use a transparent code structure for verifiable results.    
&emsp;The two main frameworks available:  
&emsp;1. Pyomo in Python  
&emsp;2. JuMP in Julia  
&emsp;GenX will be used to use Julia+ JuMP.
* Data  
&emsp;We will base the input data on the 2020 ISP inputs and some NEM network models at different levels of detail from advisor will be provides
* Computing resources  
&emsp;We are suggested to work on goliath supercomputing cluster. GenX, or any large-scale numerical modeling tool, will quickly overwhelm 
most consumer computing machines, so the intention here is that using goliath will overcome any computational hurdles.
* Project themes  
&emsp;- Hydrogen sector expansion  
&emsp;- Community energy storage  
&emsp;- Electric Vehicles  
&emsp;- Rapid renewable growth policies
